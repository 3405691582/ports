LAPACK is written in Fortran77 and provides routines for solving
systems of simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of
linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value
problems. The associated matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR,
SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are also provided, as are related
computations such as reordering of the Schur factorizations and
estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are handled,
but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality
is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double
precision.

The BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms) are routines that provide
standard building blocks for performing basic vector and matrix
operations. The Level 1 BLAS perform scalar, vector and vector-vector
operations, the Level 2 BLAS perform matrix-vector operations, and
the Level 3 BLAS perform matrix-matrix operations. Because the BLAS
are efficient, portable, and widely available, they are commonly used
in the development of high quality linear algebra software, LAPACK
for example.
