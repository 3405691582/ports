Patsy is a Python library for describing statistical models (especially
linear models, or models that have a linear component) and building
design matrices. Patsy brings the convenience of R formulas to Python.

patsy is no longer under active development. The spiritual successor of
this project is Formulaic (https://github.com/matthewwardrop/formulaic).
