The C++ Mathematical Expression Toolkit Library (ExprTk) is a
versatile, simple to use, easy to integrate and extremely efficient
runtime mathematical expression parser and evaluation engine. ExprTk
supports numerous forms of functional, logical and vector processing
semantics and is very easily extendible.
