Math::BigInt::GMP is a backend library for Math::BigInt, Math::BigFloat,
Math::BigRat and related modules.

Math::BigInt::GMP provides support for big integer calculations by means
of the GMP C library. See <https://gmplib.org/> for more information
about the GMP library.

Math::BigInt::GMP no longer uses Math::GMP, but provides its own XS layer
to access the GMP C library. This cuts out another (Perl subroutine)
layer and also reduces the memory footprint.

Math::BigInt::GMP inherits from Math::BigInt::Lib.
