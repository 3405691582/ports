The MDB Tools project is a effort to document the MDB file format used
in Microsoftâ€™s Access database package, and to provide a set of tools
and applications to make that data available on other platforms.

Specifically, MDB Tools includes programs to export schema and data to
other databases such as MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, PostgreSQL, and others.

Also included are a SQL engine for performing simple SQL queries, and
a sparse but functional ODBC driver.

MDB Tools currently has read-only support for Access 97 (Jet 3) and
Access 2000/2002 (Jet 4) formats.
