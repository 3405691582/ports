Mini vMac can emulate early Macintoshes. The Macintosh Plus (minivmac)
and the Macintosh II (minivmac-ii) are supported on OpenBSD.

Mini vMac requires a correct ROM for the Mac model to emulate. It will
look for the following filenames depending on the build:

- vMac.ROM for minivmac
- MacII.ROM for minivmac-ii
- Mac128K.ROM for minivmac-m128k

These need to be in the current directory before executing Mini vMac.

Mini vMac can boot an image file (such as an OS). This can be named
"disk1.dsk" and if placed in the current directory before executing
"minivmac" it will be loaded.

Alternatively, the ROM and the image can also be drag-and-dropped into
the minivmac window. Make sure to load the ROM first before the image.
