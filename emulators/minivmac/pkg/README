| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mini vMac can emulate early Macintoshes. The Macintosh Plus (minivmac)
and the Macintosh II (minivmac-ii) are supported on OpenBSD.

Mini vMac requires a correct ROM for the Mac model to emulate, named either
"vMac.ROM" or "MacII.ROM". This can be in the current directory before
executing the "minivmac" command.

Mini vMac can boot an image file (such as an OS). This can be named
"disk1.dsk" and if placed in the current directory before executing
"minivmac" it will be loaded.

Alternatively, the ROM and the image can also be drag-and-dropped into
the minivmac window. Make sure to load the ROM first before the image.
