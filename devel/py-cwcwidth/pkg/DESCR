To compute the number of columns needed to print a string, POSIX.1-2001
and POSIX.1-2008 define two functions: wcwidth and wcswidth. Given a
character or string, they return the required number of columns or error
out with -1 if they encounter a nonprintable character.

This module presents a Python interface to these functions.

It is similar to "wcwidth", but using the C functions directly instead
of Python emulations.
