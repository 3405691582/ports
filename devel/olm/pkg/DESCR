An implementation of the Double Ratchet cryptographic ratchet described by
https://whispersystems.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/, written in C and
C++11 and exposed as a C API.

IMPORTANT: libolm is now deprecated.

libolm was Matrix's first implementation of the Double Ratchet algorithm,
dating back to 2015. It is not written in memory-safe langauges (C and C++11),
resulting in several CVEs over the years (e.g. CVE-2021-34813 and
CVE-2021-44538). It also depends on simplistic cryptography primitive
implementations which are intended for pragmatic and education purposes rather
than security - e.g. Brad Conte's crypto-algorithms.

As a result, the libolm team rewrote libolm in Rust in December 2021 - the
result being vodozemac, and announced it as the recommended successor to libolm
after its audit by Least Authority in May 2022.
