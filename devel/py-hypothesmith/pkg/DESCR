This package provides two strategies for "Hypothesis" for generating
Python source code.

The generated code will always be syntatically valid, and is useful for
testing parsers, linters, auto-formatters, and other tools that operate
on source code.

DO NOT EXECUTE CODE GENERATED BY THESE STRATEGIES.

It could do literally anything that running Python code is able to do,
including changing, deleting, or uploading important data. Arbitrary
code can be useful, but "arbitrary code execution" can be very, very
bad.
