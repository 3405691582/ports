This module provides accelerated versions of cached_property. It is
derived from 'yarl'.

The API is designed to be nearly identical to the built-in
cached_property class, except for the additional under_cached_property
class which uses self._cache instead of self.__dict__ to store the
cached values and prevents __set__ from being called.
