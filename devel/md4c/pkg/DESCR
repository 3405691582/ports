MD4C is Markdown parser implementation in C, with the following features:

* Compliance: Generally, MD4C aims to be compliant to the latest version of
CommonMark specification. Currently, we are fully compliant to CommonMark 0.31.

* Extensions: MD4C supports some commonly requested and accepted extensions.

* Performance: MD4C is very fast.

* Compactness: MD4C parser is implemented in one source file and one header
file. There are no dependencies other than standard C library.

* Embedding: MD4C parser is easy to reuse in other projects, its API is very
straightforward: There is actually just one function, md_parse().

* Push model: MD4C parses the complete document and calls few callback functions
provided by the application to inform it about a start/end of every block, a
start/end of every span, and with any textual contents.

* Encoding: MD4C by default expects UTF-8 encoding of the input document. But it
can be compiled to recognize ASCII-only control characters (i.e. to disable all
Unicode-specific code), or (on Windows) to expect UTF-16 (i.e. what is on
Windows commonly called just "Unicode").
