dill extends Python's pickle module for serializing and de-serializing
Python objects to the majority of the built-in Python types.

Serialization is the process of converting an object to a byte
stream, and the inverse of which is converting a byte stream back
to a Python object hierarchy.

dill is not intended to be secure against erroneously or maliciously
constructed data. It is left to the user to decide whether the data they
unpickle is from a trustworthy source.
