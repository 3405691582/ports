pytz brings the Olson tz database into Python. This library allows
accurate and cross platform timezone calculations using Python 2.4
or higher. It also solves the issue of ambiguous times at the end of
daylight savings, which you can read more about in the Python Library
Reference (datetime.tzinfo).

Projects using Python 3.9 or later should be using the support now
included as part of the standard library, and third party packages
work with it such as https://pypi.org/project/tzdata/. pytz offers no
advantages beyond backwards compatibility with code written for earlier
versions of Python.
