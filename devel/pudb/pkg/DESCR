PuDB is a full screen console-based python debugger. Features include:

- syntax-highlighted source: stack, breakpoints and variables are
visible and continuously updated.

- simple, keyboard-based navigation using single keystrokes.

- use search to find relevant source code, or use "m" to invoke the
module browser that shows loaded modules, lets you load new ones and
reload existing ones.

- breakpoints can be set just by pointing at a source line and hitting
"b" and then edited visually in the breakpoints window.
