sh is a full-fledged subprocess replacement for Python that allows you
to call any program as if it were a function:

    from sh import ifconfig
    print(ifconfig("eth0"))

sh is not a collection of system commands implemented in Python.

sh relies on various Unix system calls and only works on Unix-like
operating systems - Linux, macOS, BSDs etc. Specifically, Windows is
not supported.
