The package asynctest is built on top of the standard unittest module
and cuts down boilerplate code when testing libraries for asyncio.

asynctest imports the standard unittest package, overrides some of its
features and adds new ones. A test author can import asynctest in place
of unittest safely.

It is divided in submodules, but they are all imported at the top level,
so asynctest.case.TestCase is equivalent to asynctest.TestCase.
