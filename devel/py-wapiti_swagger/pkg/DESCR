The Wapiti Swagger Parser is a Python library designed to parse Swagger
(OpenAPI) specifications and extract the necessary information to
generate valid HTTP requests. It focuses on providing a clean,
programmatic interface for analyzing Swagger files and creating request
templates without relying on external tools for OpenAPI processing.

This library is particularly useful for scenarios where only the request
generation requirements are of interest, such as:

Automated testing and validation of APIs.
 - Dynamic request generation for web vulnerability scanners.
 - Custom API tooling.

The library is lightweight, relying only on Python's built-in json
library and PyYAML for file parsing, and it avoids heavy dependencies on
larger OpenAPI frameworks.
