The DateTime::Tiny Perl module implements an extremely lightweight
object that represents a datetime.

Compared to the larger DateTime module, DateTime::Tiny is faster and
uses much less memory.

The API is intended to be as close as possible to that for DateTime,
but DateTime::Tiny implements less of it: it provides the functionality
required to represent a date as an object, to stringify the date and
to parse it back in, but does not allow you to modify the dates.
