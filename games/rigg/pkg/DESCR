rigg serves as a thin, OpenBSD-adapted runtime wrapper for independent games
based on certain engines. rigg handles visibility of files by using unveil(2)
to hide those that conflict with execution on OpenBSD. This solves a common
problem with commercial games based on open-source frameworks like FNA, LibGDX,
or HashLink. In addition, rigg also enforces a minimum-necessary filesystem view
by default via unveil(2). Some basic engine configuration for OpenBSD like
dllmap for mono(1) is included.
