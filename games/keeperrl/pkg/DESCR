KeeperRL is an ambitious dungeon simulator with roguelike and RPG
elements. Take the role of an evil wizard and study the methods of
black magic. Equip your minions and explore the world, murder
innocent villagers and burn their homes. Build your dungeon, lay
traps and prepare for an assault of angry heroes.

When you control your minions the game changes into a classic
roguelike, with turn-based and very tactical combat. You can also
play as an adventurer and assault dungeons made by you or other
players.
