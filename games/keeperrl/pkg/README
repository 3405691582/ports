| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Free Assets
=================

The game includes a set of free ASCII art assets. You can use them by launching
it with `--data_dir` pointing at the directory:

$ keeper --data_dir=${TRUEPREFIX}/share/keeperrl/

Note the free assets don't include sound effects or music.

Using Commercial Assets
=======================

There are several ways to obtain the commercial assets which are listed
on the homepage, including by donating to animal charity. To use them for the
game, either run `keeper` from the directory with the game's files (including
appconfig.txt and data/), or use `--data_dir`:

$ keeper --data_dir=/path/to/keeperrl/files/

Userdir Location
================

${PKGSTEM} is built with ENABLE_LOCAL_USER_DIR, making ~/.local/share/KeeperRL
the default writable directory for user data. This can be overridden with the
flag `--user_dir=/path/to/userdir` or by setting XDG_DATA_HOME in the
environment.
