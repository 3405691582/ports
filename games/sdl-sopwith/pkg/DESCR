SDL Sopwith is a port of the classic biplane shoot 'em-up "Sopwith"
to run on modern computers and operating systems. It is named
"SDL Sopwith" as it uses the LibSDL cross-platform library.

SDL Sopwith is based on the original Sopwith source code, which was
released by its author David L. Clark as Free and Open Source
Software under the GNU General Public License.
