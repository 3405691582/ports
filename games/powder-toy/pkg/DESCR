The Powder Toy is a free physics sandbox game, which simulates air pressure and
velocity, heat, gravity and a countless number of interactions between different
substances! The game provides you with various building materials, liquids,
gases and electronic components which can be used to construct complex machines,
guns, bombs, realistic terrains and almost anything else. You can then mine them
and watch cool explosions, add intricate wirings, play with little stickmen or
operate your machine. You can browse and play thousands of different saves made
by the community or upload your own! There is a Lua API - you can automate your
work or even make plugins for the game.
