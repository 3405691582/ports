| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Datasize
========

${PKGSTEM} needs datasize of at least 4-6G to launch, see login.conf(5) and
ksh(1). Recommended datasize for Beyond All Reason is 8G.

How to play
===========

${PKGSTEM} itself only provides the building blocks, so in order to run
anything, you need to add an engine and a lobby. Depending on the lobby you may
also need to install maps. Each game built on ${PKGSTEM} may have special
requirements and may depend on different tools to download and install.

Beyond All Reason
-----------------

https://www.beyondallreason.info/

${PKGSTEM} comes with a helper script named beyond-all-reason.

	$ beyond-all-reason

The script take care of required settings and update to last engine and lobby
version available before running the game. It will install and run with
isolation in ~/.local/state/BAR.

Other Usage Hints
=================

Home directories
----------------

${PKGSTEM} may install files and settings into:

	1. $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/spring
	2. ~/.config/spring
	3. ~/.spring

Installing Engines
------------------

The best known and best supported engines for ${PKGSTEM} are Zero-K and
Beyond All Reason. For example, install Zero-K this way:

	$ pr-downloader zk:test

And Beyond All Reason:

	$ pr-downloader byar:test

It will then show up as an engine that can be selected in the ${PKGSTEM} GUI.

Installing Lobbies
------------------

Running ${PKGSTEM} without a lobby set up will allow testing of maps, engines,
and settings.

To install Chobby lobby, run the following:

	$ pr-downloader chobby:test	# latest test version

Then launch it for example with:

	$ spring --menu 'rapid://chobby:test'

Or set it as the default by adding `DefaultLuaMenu = <menu> <version>' to
~/.config/spring/springsettings.cfg.

Installing Maps
---------------

Maps can be installed in one of three ways: via the lobby interface, with
pr-downloader, or by manually downloading the map and placing it in
~/.spring/maps/. Repositories for maps (subject to change) can for example be
found at:

	https://zero-k.info/Maps
	https://www.beyondallreason.info/maps
	https://springrts.com/wiki/Maps

Troubleshooting
===============

If ${PKGSTEM} fails to launch, you can try the flag `-safemode'.
