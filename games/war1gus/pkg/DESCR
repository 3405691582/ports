War1gus is a re-implementation of "Warcraft: Orcs & Humans" that allows you to
play Warcraft with the Stratagus engine. The game uses graphics and sounds from
the original Warcraft, but improves the gameplay mechanisms with many modern
conveniences that the Stratagus engine allows, such as modern mouse controls,
named groups, larger group selection, more player factions in multiplayer games,
a map editor, and multiple towns.
