How to Install the Required Assets
==================================

You need assets (icons, art, graphics, music) to run the game, either from the
purchased game or free assets from the Make and Play Edition (can use Windows
version assets):

Copy 'data.zip' to ~/.local/share/VVVVVV/ as follows:

$ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/VVVVVV
$ cp data.zip ~/.local/share/VVVVVV/
$ VVVVVV	# starts the game

Alternatively, you can specify a custom asset directory with '-assets <dir>':

$ unzip data.zip -d /path/to/assets
$ VVVVVV -assets /path/to/assets
