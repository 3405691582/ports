This is a little HTTP/1.1 library written from scratch in Python,
heavily inspired by hyper-h2.

It's a "bring-your-own-I/O" library; h11 contains no IO code whatsoever.
This means you can hook h11 up to your favorite network API, and that
could be anything you want: synchronous, threaded, asynchronous, or your
own implementation of RFC 6214 - h11 won't judge you.

This also means that h11 is not immediately useful out of the box:
it's a toolkit for building programs that speak HTTP, not something
that could directly replace requests or twisted.web or whatever. But
h11 makes it much easier to implement something like requests or
twisted.web.
