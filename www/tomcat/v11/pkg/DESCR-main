The Apache Tomcat software is an open source implementation of
the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Pages, Jakarta Expression Language,
Jakarta WebSocket, Jakarta Annotations and Jakarta Authentication
specifications. These specifications are part of the Jakarta EE
platform.

Tomcat 11 implements the Jakarta EE 11 specifications: Servlet 6.1,
JSP 4.0, EL 6.0, WebSocket 2.2 and Authentication 3.1.

Tomcat includes many additional features that make it a useful platform
for developing and deploying web applications and web services.

Tomcat can be run as a standalone web server with Servlet and JSP
support, or using Apache HTTP Server as its web server via the mod_jk
Apache module (see the ap2-mod_jk package).
