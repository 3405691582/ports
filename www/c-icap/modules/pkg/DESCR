This package provides various filtering modules for use with c-icap.
Policy profiles are available based on c-icap ACLs.

- block pages or replace text

srv_url_check: database-based URL filtering
- allow/block URLs
- support for legacy squidGuard databases

virus_scan: virus scanning, with sub-modules:
- clamd-mod uses an existing clamd instance (possibly not working)
