Since Reddit has changed their API terms, tuir does not work out of the
box anymore. The following steps are required to make it work:

1. Log on to reddit.com and open https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Click on "create application" and fill out the form:
   - name: can be anything, for example "tuir"
   - ( ) web app
     ( ) installed app
     (x) script
   - description: anything or leave empty
   - about url: leave empty
   - redirect uri: http://127.0.0.1:65000/
3. Complete the Captcha and click "create app"
4. Note down the "secret"
5. Note down the "client id", which is the string displayed above the 
   secret, directly under "presonal use script".

Once the "app" is created, tuir can be configured to use it.

1. run the command: tuir --copy-config
2. Open ~/.config/tuir/tuir.cfg in an editor and replace the values in
   the following entries with the ones optained above:

   oauth_client_id = <reddit app client id>
   oauth_client_secret = <reddit app secret>
   oauth_redirect_uri = http://127.0.0.1:65000/

tuir should work now.
