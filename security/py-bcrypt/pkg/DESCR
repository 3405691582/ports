py-bcrypt is a Python wrapper of OpenBSD's Blowfish password hashing code,
as described in "A Future-Adaptable Password Scheme" by Niels Provos and
David Mazieres.

This system hashes passwords using a version of Bruce Schneier's
Blowfish block cipher with modifications designed to raise the cost of
off-line password cracking and frustrate fast hardware implementation.
The computation cost of the algorithm is parametised, so it can be
increased as computers get faster. The intent is to make a compromise
of a password database less likely to result in an attacker gaining
knowledge of the plaintext passwords (e.g. using John the Ripper).

While bcrypt remains an acceptable choice for password storage,
depending on your specific use case you may also want to consider using
scrypt (either via standard library or cryptography) or argon2id via
argon2_cffi.
