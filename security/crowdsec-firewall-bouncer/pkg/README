The crowdsec firewall bouncer needs two pf tables so setting these up is
necessary in order for the bouncer to work.

table <crowdsec-blacklists> persist
table <crowdsec6-blacklists> persist

These tables can then be used to block traffic, for example:

block drop in quick from <crowdsec-blacklists> to any
block drop in quick from <crowdsec6-blacklists> to any
