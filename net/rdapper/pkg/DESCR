rdapper is a simple RDAP client. It uses Net::RDAP to retrieve data
about internet resources (domain names, IP addresses, and autonomous
systems) and outputs the information in a human-readable format.

You can pass any internet resource as an argument; this may be:

- a "forward" domain name such as example.com
- a top-level domain such as com
- a IPv4 or IPv6 address or CIDR prefix, such as 192.168.0.1 or 2001:DB8::/32
- an Autonomous System Number such as AS65536
- a "reverse" domain name such as 168.192.in-addr.arpa
- the URL of an RDAP resource
- the "tagged" handle of an entity, such as an LIR, registrar, or domain
admin/tech contact.
