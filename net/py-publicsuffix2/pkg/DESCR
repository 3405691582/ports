This module allows you to get the public suffix, as well as the
registrable domain, of a domain name using the Public Suffix List from
http://publicsuffix.org

A public suffix is a domain suffix under which you can register domain
names, or under which the suffix owner does not control the subdomains.
Some examples of public suffixes in the former example are ".com",
".co.uk" and "pvt.k12.wy.us"; examples of the latter case are
"github.io" and "blogspot.com". The public suffix is sometimes referred
to as the effective or extended TLD (eTLD). Accurately knowing the
public suffix of a domain is useful when handling web browser cookies,
highlighting the most important part of a domain name in a user
interface or sorting URLs by web site. It is also used in a wide range
of research and applications that leverages Domain Name System (DNS)
data.
