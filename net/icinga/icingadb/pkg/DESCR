Icinga DB is an Icinga configuration and state database supporting
multiple environments. It can be used instead of the deprecated Icinga
Data Output, IDO, for database synchronization.

Icinga DB is a set of components for publishing, synchronizing and
visualizing monitoring data in the Icinga ecosystem, consisting of:

* The Icinga DB daemon, which synchronizes monitoring data between a
  Redis server and a database.

* Icinga 2 with its Icinga DB feature enabled, responsible for
  publishing the data to the Redis server, i.e. configuration and its
  runtime updates, check results, state changes, downtimes,
  acknowledgements, notifications, and other events such as flapping.

* Icinga Web with the Icinga DB Web module enabled, which connects
  to both Redis and the database to display and work with the most
  recent data.
