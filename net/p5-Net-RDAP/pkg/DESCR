Net::RDAP provides an interface to the Registration Data Access Protocol
(RDAP).

RDAP is replacing Whois as the preferred way of obtainining information
about Internet resources (IP addresses, autonomous system numbers,
and domain names). As of writing, RDAP is fully supported by Regional
Internet Registries (who are responsible for the allocation of IP
addresses and AS numbers) and generic TLD operators (e.g. .com, .org,
.xyz) but is still being rolled out among country-code registries.

Net::RDAP does all the hard work of determining the correct server to
query (Net::RDAP::Registry is an interface to the IANA registry of RDAP
services), querying the server (Net::RDAP::UA is an RDAP HTTP user
agent), and parsing the response (Net::RDAP::Object and its submodules
provide access to the data returned by the server). As such, it provides
a single unified interface to information about all unique Internet
identifiers.
