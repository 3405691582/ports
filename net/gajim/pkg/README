Gajim Plugins
=============

Upstream keeps removing the plugin installer plugin from the
distribution tarball, so automatic of plugin installation is not
possible at this point.

To install plugins, clone the plugins repository:

git clone \
    https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins \
    ~/.local/share/gajim/plugins/

Also, upstream decided to check for the output of sys.platform and
compare to a json file on the plugins manifest.  Of course, this only
includes "linux", "win32" and "darwin" for the majority of the plugins,
so none of them will work on OpenBSD.  Some were tested by adding
"openbsd7" to the list of platforms on the manifest JSON file for each
plugin and they just work.  So, for each plugin you want to enable, edit
the corresponding "plugin-manifest.json" file and add "openbsd7" to the
list of platforms, and give it a try.

Some plugins in Gajim require additional Python modules to function
properly.  For instance, in order to use the OMEMO plugin, axolotl is
required.  This is available on OpenBSD via the py3-axolotl package or
net/py-axolotl,python3 port.
