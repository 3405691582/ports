Listen on localhost only
========================

openHAB is configured by sourcing environment variables from /etc/openhab.conf.
By default openHAB listens on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http) and 8443 (https).

We've opted to default to 127.0.0.1 for obvious security reasons. To restore the
original behavior make the following change in /etc/openhab.conf:

OPENHAB_HTTP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0

Refer to https://www.openhab.org/docs/ for more details.
