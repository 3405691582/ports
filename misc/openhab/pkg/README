Listen on localhost only
========================

openHAB is configured by sourcing environment variables from /etc/openhab.conf.
By default openHAB listens on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http) and 8443 (https).

We've opted to default to 127.0.0.1 for obvious security reasons. To restore the
original behavior make the following change in /etc/openhab.conf:

OPENHAB_HTTP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0

Refer to https://www.openhab.org/docs/ for more details.

Access to serial devices
========================

openHAB runs as user _openhab. By default, this user will not be able to access
serial devices. If, for example, you plan to access a locally connected USB
dongle for Zigbee or Z-Wave, you will need to add the _openhab user to the
'dialer' group. Further, you will also need to edit /etc/openhab.conf and
adjust EXTRA_JAVA_OPTS accordingly.

Please note, you will have to find a Java wrapper library for native serial port
access. The example of passing "-Dgnu.io.rxtx.SerialPorts" uses the rxtx library
which is currently unsupported on OpenBSD. This may change in the future.

Refer to https://www.openhab.org/docs/ for more details.
