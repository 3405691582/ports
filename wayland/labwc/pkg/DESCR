Labwc is a wlroots-based window-stacking compositor for wayland, inspired
by openbox.

It is light-weight and independent with a focus on simply stacking
windows well and rendering some window decorations. It relies on clients
for panels, screenshots, wallpapers and so on to create a full desktop
environment.
