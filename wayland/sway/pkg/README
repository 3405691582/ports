| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration
=============

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config` and it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy
the sample configuration file to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config`. It is
usually located at `${SYSCONFDIR}/sway/config`.  Run `man 5 sway` for
information on the configuration.

Running
=======

On OpenBSD, use the provided ${PREFIX}/bin/startsway.sh script to
launch sway from an text VT (xenodm must be stopped).  Customize it to
your needs.
