topydo is a powerful todo list application using the todo.txt format.

It has three user interfaces:

Command Line Interface (CLI) - originally inspired by the todo.txt CLI by
Gina Trapani.

Prompt mode - a convenience mode for the CLI. Launch with topydo prompt.

Column mode - a text based user interface (TUI) with customizable columns
and vim-like bindings. Launch with topydo columns.
