The Docker command-line tool allows you to control remote Docker hosts.
You can use it to build docker images, start docker containers, execute
commands inside containers, see running containers, and view logs.

Note that Docker cannot be run natively on OpenBSD because it is
Linux-specific, but you can run Linux+Docker in an OpenBSD vm.
One description of how to do so can be found at
