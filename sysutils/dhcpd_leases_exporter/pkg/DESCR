This exporter consumes the dhcpd.leases file which is periodically
written by the dameon.  It has two collectors:

The Stats collector counts the number of leases PER UNIQUE IP found
in dhcpd.leases. This means that if an IP was leased to client X,
but is now leased to client Y, there will be only one entry counted
(the most recent one). This is in line with how dhcpd reads the
file.

The Leases collector will create a vector gague for each client
with an active DHCP lease found in dhcpd.leases. Because this
collector may produce tons of short-lived vectors depending on how
busy DHCPD is, it is disabled by default
