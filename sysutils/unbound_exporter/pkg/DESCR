This simple Prometheus metrics exporter for the Unbound DNS resolver
connects to Unbound's TLS control socket and sends the stats_noreset
command, causing Unbound to return metrics as key-value pairs. The
metrics exporter converts Unbound metric names to Prometheus metric
names and labels by using a set of regular expressions.

It also supports additional metrics exported by setting
'extended-statistics: yes' in unbound.conf.
