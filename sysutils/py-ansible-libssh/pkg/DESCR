Ansible-libssh is a new LibSSH Connection Plugin for Ansible Network
that replaces Paramiko.  Since most network appliances don't support
or have limited capability for the local execution of a third party
software, the Ansible network modules are not copied to the remote
host unlike linux hosts; instead, they run on the control node
itself. Hence, Ansible network can't use the typical Ansible SSH
connection plugin that is used with linux host. Furthermore, due
to this behavior, performance of the underlying SSH subsystem is
critical. Not only is the new LibSSH connection plugin enabling
FIPS readiness, but it was also designed to be more performant than
the existing Paramiko SSH subsystem.
