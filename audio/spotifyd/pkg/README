With credentials in an XDG configuration file spotifyd is ready to run, e.g.
as daemon in ~/.xsession or on-demand via clients such as "spotify-qt":

  [spotifyd]
  username = "user@example.com"
  password = "secret"

Alternatively, the rc.d(8) script runs as dedicated user, but lacks D-Bus
configuration, hence features like the MPRIS interface do not work (yet).

Follow sndio(7) Authentication if both dedicated and your own user shall be
able to play audio at the same time, e.g. on a desktop system:

  # install -D -p -o _spotifyd -m 0600 ~/.sndio/cookie ${HOME_DIR}/.sndio/cookie
