You will need to use a suitable hardware device to interface with
Zigbee, and that device will often need to have specific firmware
loaded before it can be used. Refer to upstream documentation for
more information.

Device permissions
------------------
zigbee2mqtt uses USB devices which present themselves as serial ports
(/dev/cuaU0 if this is the only USB serial device on the system).

The user running the daemon (normally _z2m) must have access to the
relevant serial port device nodes. zigbee2mqtt will not start unless
either this is done, or configuration is changed to use a network-
based device.

Either edit /etc/group and add _z2m to "dialer", or if you would like
to restrict it to a specific device, change the group ownership of
the relevant /dev/cuaU* device to _z2m.

The default configuration installed by the package starts a front-end
on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ - edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml
to change or disable this.
