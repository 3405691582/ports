zigbee2mqtt allows you to use your Zigbee devices without the vendor's
bridge or gateway.

It bridges events and allows you to control your Zigbee devices via
MQTT. In this way you can integrate your Zigbee devices with whatever
smart home infrastructure you are using.

To use it, you will need suitable Zigbee bridge hardware (typically
USB-based), Zigbee devices, and an MQTT server (for example, mosquitto
or rabbitmq).

zigbee2mqtt has mature support for adapters based on TI zStack, SiLabs
EmberZNet, and Dresden Elektronik deCONZ. It has experimental support
for some others. Most of these are USB devices presenting as a serial
UART (/dev/cuaU*) when running the correct firmware - it has some
support for network-based (wifi/ethernet) devices.
