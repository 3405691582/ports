zigpy-znp is a Python library that adds support to zigpy for radio
modules using Texas Instruments Zigbee Network Processor (ZNP) devices
running compatible Z-Stack firmware. It also provides tools that can be
run from the command line. See TOOLS.md for basic information; small
adaptations are needed for OpenBSD, e.g.

$ python3 -m zigpy_znp.tools.network_backup /dev/cuaU0 -o network_backup.json
$ python3 -m zigpy_znp.tools.energy_scan -a /dev/cuaU0
$ python3 -m zigpy_znp.tools.network_scan -a -c 11 /dev/cuaU0

Several ranges of controller are supported, including the recommended
CC2652- and CC1352-based ones. These are often supplied with firmware
that requires replacing before they can be used. See documentation,
but common hardware includes:

- Electrolama zzh CC2652R and Slaesh CC2652R sticks (running Z-Stack 3
firmware) - can be flashed using cc2538-bsl.

- TI LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1 (running Z-Stack 3 firmware).

- CC2531 (running Z-Stack Home 1.2). You can flash CC2531ZNP-Prod.bin
to your stick directly with zigpy_znp's flash_write tool if your stick
already has a serial bootloader.
