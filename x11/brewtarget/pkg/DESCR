Brewtarget automatically calculates color, bitterness, and other
parameters for you while you drag and drop ingredients into the
recipe. Brewtarget also has many other tools such as priming sugar
calculators, OG correction help, and a unique mash designing tool.
It also can export and import recipes in BeerJSON and BeerXML,
allowing you to easily share recipes with friends who use BeerSmith
or other programs.
