xmsm is simple session manager that provides session configuration
and screen locking and also launches the window manager and the
toolbox.

xmtoolbox is an application launcher/menu configured with a simple
text file. It also communicates with the session manager to provide
lock, log out, and shutdown commands.

An example toolbox configuration file can be copied from
