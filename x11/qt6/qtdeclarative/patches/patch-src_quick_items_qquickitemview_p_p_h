Subject: [PATCH] ListView: fix countChanged not being emitted in certain cases

This broke after 477c15def834bd49553c00b90f3a2006456ea931.
countChanged would have normally been emitted in the call to
applyModelChanges that we skipped after adding the q->size().isNull()
check.

We can check hasPendingChanges() to know if a count change
is pending (which is also the first thing applyModelChanges checks
before doing its work), and if so, emit countChanged so that
any bindings that are relying on it can function as expected.

Fixes: QTBUG-129165
