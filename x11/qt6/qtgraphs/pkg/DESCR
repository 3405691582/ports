The Qt Graphs module enables you to visualize data in 2D and 3D graphs. In the
3D realm there is support for bar, scatter, and surface graphs. It's especially
useful for visualizing depth maps and large quantities of rapidly changing
data, such as data received from multiple sensors. The look and feel of graphs
can be customized by using themes or by adding custom items and labels.
