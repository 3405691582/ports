Xfce4-timer-plugin is a simple plugin that lets the user run an alarm
at a specified time or at the end of a specified countdown period.

The icon displays a progress bar showing the percentage of the time
elapsed. The bar changes color when active from silver to blue.

Left-clicking on the icon opens a menu of available alarms. After
selecting one, the user can start or stop the timer by selecting the
'start/stop timer' entry in the same menu.
