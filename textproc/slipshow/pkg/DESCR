Slipshow is a tool specifically designed for technical presentations where
traditional slides are not enough.

In a slipshow presentation, the equivalent of a slide is called a slip. Each
slip is like a slide, but with no bottom limit. That is, the content can be
arbitrarily long! During the presentation, the camera will "scroll" down to
reveal the hidden content, following a script given by the presenter!

Here are the goals of slipshow, in no specific orders:

- Lift restrictions from traditional slide-based presentation. In particular,
  make it closer to a blackboard presentation!

- Easy to write and readable syntax: markdown with few extensions. No manual
  placement like in powerpoint. No crazy syntax like in latex.

- Source of the presentation is plain text: much better for source control,
  sharing with people, using your favorite editor, readability, compatibility.

- Open the possibility for a dynamic presentation. Watching scientific
  popularization video demonstrates how well-chosen animations can make a
  difficult subject more understandable.

Slipshow compiles files written in an extension of markdown, to a standalone
html file viewable offline in any web browser.
