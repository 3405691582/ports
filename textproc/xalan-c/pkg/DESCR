Xalan-C++ version is a robust implementation of the W3C Recommendations
for XSL Transformations (XSLT) and the XML Path Language (XPath).
It works with the Xerces-C++ XML parser.

The Xalan-C++ project creates and distributes a standard XSLT library
and a simple Xalan command-line utility for transforming XML
documents.
