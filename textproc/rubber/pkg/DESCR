Rubber is a building system for LaTeX documents. It is based on a
routine that runs just as many compilations as necessary and runs
companion programs like BibTeX and Makeindex when needed.

The module system provides a great flexibility that virtually allows
support for any package with no user intervention, as well as pre-
and post-processing of the document.

A good number of standard packages are supported, including graphics/
graphicx with automatic conversion between various graphics formats
and Metapost compilation.

The associated tool "rubber-info" extracts information, such as
dependency relations or post-compilation diagnostics.
