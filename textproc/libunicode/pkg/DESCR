The goal of this library is to bring painless unicode support to C++ with
simple and easy to understand APIs.
The API naming conventions are chosen to look familiar to those using the
C++ standard libary.

Original libunicode (at least v0.1.0 - v0.4.0) uses Unicode UCD 15.0.0
but this ports uses textproc/unicode/ucd package.
