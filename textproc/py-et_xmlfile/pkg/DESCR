et_xmlfile is a low memory library for creating large XML files.

This is an implementation of lxml's xmlfile module for the standard
library's ElementTree. It aims to allow code to be developed that will
work with both libraries.

It was developed initially for the openpyxl project but is now a
standalone module.
