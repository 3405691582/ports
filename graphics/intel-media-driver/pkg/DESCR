VA-API (Video Acceleration API) user mode driver for Intel GEN Graphics
family

VA-API is an open-source library and API specification, which provides
access to graphics hardware acceleration capabilities for video
processing. It consists of a main library and driver-specific
acceleration backends for each supported hardware vendor.

The current video driver backend provides a bridge to the GEN GPUs
through the packaging of buffers and commands to be sent to the i915
driver for exercising both hardware and shader functionality for video
decode, encode, and processing.
