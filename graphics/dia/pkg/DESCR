Dia is an application to create technical diagrams. It provides various sets of
diagram building blocks from basic tools (line, polyline, polygon, arc, ellipse,
curves, boxes and text) as well as special sets for Flowchart, UML, SADT,
Network diagrams and many more areas.  If you need your own set of diagram
objects you can create them yourself with the custom shape module.  Diagrams can
be exported to multiple vector graphics formats e.g. CGM, DXF, HPGL, PDF, SVG,
VDX, WPG, Xfig and common bitmap formats. There are specialized exporters to
generate source code from UML diagrams.  Dia can also import graphics from
vector (DXF, SVG, VDX, WPG, XFig) and bitmap formats.
