Similar to how most modern network printers support "driverless" printing,
using the universal vendor-neutral printing protocol, many modern network
scanners and MFPs support "driverless" scanning.

Driverless scanning comes in two flavors:
* Apple AirScan or AirPrint scanning (official protocol name is eSCL)
* Microsoft WSD, or WS-Scan (term WSD means "Web Services for Devices")

This backend implements both protocols, choosing automatically between them.
This backend doesn't require to install and doesn't conflict with
vendor-provided proprietary software like ScanGear from Canon, HPLIP from HP
and so on.
